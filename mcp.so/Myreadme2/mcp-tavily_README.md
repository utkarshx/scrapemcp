## Installation

### Use `pip`

Simply run:

```bash
pip install mcp-tavily
```

or if you have `uv` installed:

```bash
uv pip install mcp-tavily
```

### Build the Server
Clone this repository and build and install the program with your default Python interpreter (recommended).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RamXX/mcp-tavily.git
cd mcp-tavily
uv build
uv pip install .
```

After installation, you can run it as a script using:

```
python -m mcp_server_tavily
```

## Configuration

### API Key

The server requires a Tavily API key to function. You can obtain one from [Tavily's website](https://tavily.com). The API key can be provided in two ways:

1. As an environment variable:
```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. As a command-line argument:
```bash
python -m mcp_server_tavily --api-key=your_api_key_here
```

### Configure for Claude.app

Add to your Claude settings:

<details>
<summary>Using pip installation</summary>

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "tavily": {
    "command": "python",
    "args": ["-m", "mcp_server_tavily"]
  },
  "env": {
        "TAVILY_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
  }
}
```
</details>

If you see any issue, you may want to use the full path for the Python interpreter you are using. You can do a `which python` to find out the exact path if needed.

Remember to set the TAVILY_API_KEY environment variable or provide it via the --api-key argument.

## Examples

For a regular search:

```
Tell me about Anthropic's newly released MCP protocol
```

To generate a report with explicit exclusions:

```
Tell me about redwood trees. Please use MLA format in markdown syntax and include the URLs in the citations. Exclude Wikipedia sources.
```

To force Claude to use the answer mode function call, be explicit in your ask:

```
I want a concrete answer backed by current web sources: What is the average lifespan of redwood trees?
```

For news, use:

```
Give me the top 10 AI-related news in the last 5 days
```

## Debugging

You can use the MCP inspector to debug the server. For uvx installations:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mcp-server-tavily
```

Or if you've installed the package in a specific directory or are developing on it:

```
cd path/to/servers/src/tavily
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python -m mcp_server_tavily
```

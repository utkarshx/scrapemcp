                "delete": false
            }

            "description": "An app that stores information about projects. It contains an overview of the project and its progress.",
            "permissions": {

            }
        }
    ]
}

### 3. Configure MCP client like Claude Desktop

Configure your client to connect to the server.

For Claude Desktop, please edit file below:
- MacOS/Linux: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following configuration to the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kintone": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\mcp-server-kintone.exe",
      "args": [
        "C:\\path\\to\\configuration.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You may need to restart Claude Desktop to apply the changes.


### 4. Start to use

Now you can interact with kintone using your own AI tools!

For example, you can say:
- "What is the latest status of Customer A's project?"
- "Update the progress of Project B to 50%."
- "Show me the projects that are behind schedule."

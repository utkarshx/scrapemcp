### Resources

The server provides access to Google Drive files:

- **Files** (`gdrive:///<file_id>`)
  - Supports all file types
  - Google Workspace files are automatically exported:
    - Docs → Markdown
    - Sheets → CSV
    - Presentations → Plain text
    - Drawings → PNG
  - Other files are provided in their native format

## Getting started

1. [Create a new Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
2. [Enable the Google Drive API](https://console.cloud.google.com/workspace-api/products)
3. [Configure an OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) ("internal" is fine for testing)
4. Add OAuth scopes `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`
5. [Create an OAuth Client ID](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient) for application type "Desktop App"
6. Download the JSON file of your client's OAuth keys
7. Rename the key file to `gcp-oauth.keys.json` and place into the path you specify with `GDRIVE_CREDS_DIR` (i.e. `/Users/username/.config/mcp-gdrive`)
8. Note your OAuth Client ID and Client Secret. They must be provided as environment variables along with your configuration directory.

Make sure to build the server with either `npm run build` or `npm run watch`.

### Authentication

Before making requests to Google's APIs, you will be prompted to authenticate with your browser. You must authenticate with an account in the same organization as your Google Cloud project.

Your OAuth token is saved in the directory specified by the `GDRIVE_CREDS_DIR` environment variable.

### Usage with Desktop App

To integrate this server with the desktop app, add the following to your app's server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gdrive": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@isaacphi/mcp-gdrive"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CLIENT_ID": "<CLIENT_ID>",
        "CLIENT_SECRET": "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
        "GDRIVE_CREDS_DIR": "/path/to/config/directory"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

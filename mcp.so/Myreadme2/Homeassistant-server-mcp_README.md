This project is part of the AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. For more information and documentation about MCP tools, visit [www.aimcp.info](http://www.aimcp.info).

## Features

- Get device states
- Control device states (on/off)
- Trigger automations
- List available entities

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/homeassistant-server-mcp.git
cd homeassistant-server-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Configure the MCP server by adding the following to your MCP settings file (typically located at `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json` for VSCode):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "homeassistant": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/homeassistant-mcp/homeassistant-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "HA_URL": "http://your-homeassistant-url:8123",
        "HA_TOKEN": "your-long-lived-access-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `your-homeassistant-url` and `your-long-lived-access-token` with your Home Assistant instance URL and access token.

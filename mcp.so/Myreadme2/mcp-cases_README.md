# MCP Cases

MCP Cases is a format that is based on [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) and can be used for various things, f.e:

- autotest servers
- server mocking to rapidly prototype servers and to test clients
- validate libraries adherence to a protocol
- document server capabilities in machine and human readable format
- autogenerate documentation without starting the server

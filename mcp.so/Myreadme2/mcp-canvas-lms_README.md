# Canvas MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with the Canvas API. This server allows you to manage courses, assignments, enrollments, and grades within Canvas.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **Canvas API Token**: Obtain from your Canvas account
- **Canvas Domain**: Typically `canvas.instructure.com`

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/canvas-mcp-server.git
   cd canvas-mcp-server

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

Copy the example environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit .env and replace the placeholder values with your actual Canvas API token and domain.

Build the Project

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Run the Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start and listen for MCP requests via stdio.

### Connecting to Claude Desktop

1. **Update Claude Configuration**

   Add the MCP server configuration to your claude_desktop_config.json:

```
  "canvas-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "canvas-mcp-server"]
    },
```
Restart Claude Desktop

   Quit Claude Desktop completely.
   Start Claude Desktop again.
   Navigate to the ðŸ”Œ menu to find and connect your Canvas MCP server.

### Available Tools (more student focused stuff coming soon)

- `canvas_create_course`: Create a new course in Canvas.
- `canvas_update_course`: Update an existing course in Canvas.
- `canvas_create_assignment`: Create a new assignment in a Canvas course.
- `canvas_update_assignment`: Update an existing assignment.
- `canvas_submit_grade`: Submit a grade for a student's assignment.
- `canvas_enroll_user`: Enroll a user in a course.

### Error Handling

Tools return error messages with isError: true to indicate issues.
Ensure all required environment variables are set to avoid runtime errors.

### Troubleshooting

- **Build Errors:**

Check TypeScript version: npx tsc --version
   Clean and rebuild: rm -rf build/ && npm run build

- **Runtime Errors:**

   Check logs for detailed error messages.
   Ensure environment variables are correctly set.

- **Type Errors:**

   Validate types using TypeScript's type checking: npx tsc --noEmit

### Additional Notes

- **Type Safety**: The `types.ts` file ensures that all interactions with the Canvas API are type-safe, reducing runtime errors and improving code maintainability.

- **Error Handling**: The server gracefully handles errors by returning meaningful messages with the `isError` flag, allowing the client (e.g., Claude Desktop) to understand and react appropriately.

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information like API tokens are managed through environment variables, enhancing security and flexibility across different environments.

- **Modularity**: Separating concerns into different files (`types.ts`, `client.ts`, `index.ts`) makes the codebase easier to navigate and maintain.

A Model Context Protocol server that provides access to MongoDB databases. This server enables LLMs to inspect collection schemas and execute read-only queries.

## Demo

## Features

### Resources
- List and access collections via `mongodb://` URIs
- Each collection has a name, description and schema
- JSON mime type for schema access

### Tools
- **query**
  - Execute read-only MongoDB queries against the connected database
  - Input: `query` (object): The MongoDB query to execute
  - All queries are executed with read-only permissions

- **aggregate**
  - Execute read-only MongoDB queries against the connected database
  - Input: `aggregate` (object): The MongoDB query to execute
  - All queries are executed with read-only permissions

### Prompts
- `query` - Provide insights about the collection's structure, data types, and basic statistics
  - Input: `collection` (string): The name of the collection to analyze
  - Output: `text` (string): A summary of the collection's structure, data types, and basic statistics
- `aggregate` - Provide insights about the collection's structure, data types, and basic statistics
  - Input: `collection` (string): The name of the collection to analyze
  - Output: `text` (string): A summary of the collection's structure, data types, and basic statistics



## Development

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Build the server:
```bash
npm run build
```

For development with auto-rebuild:
```bash
npm run watch
```

## Installation for Development

### Using Claude Desktop

To use with Claude Desktop, add the server config:

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mongodb": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "~/mcp-mongo-server/build/index.js",
        "mongodb://muhammed:kilic@mongodb.localhost/namespace"
      ]
    },
  }
}
```


### Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.

## Components


### Resources

The server provides schema information for each collection in the database:

- **Collection Schemas** (`mongodb://<host>/<collection>/schema`)
  - JSON schema information for each collection
  - Includes field names and data types
  - Automatically inferred from collection documents


## Usage with Claude Desktop

To use this server with the Claude Desktop app, add the following configuration to the "mcpServers" section of your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mongodb": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-mongo-server",
        "mongodb://muhammed:kilic@mongodb.localhost/sample_namespace"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Installing via Smithery

To install MCP MongoDB Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/mcp-mongo-server):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install mcp-mongo-server --client claude
```

### Installing via mcp-get

You can install this package using mcp-get:

```bash
npx @michaellatman/mcp-get@latest install mcp-mongo-server
```

Replace `/sample_namespace` with your database name.

## Usage with Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kubernetes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-kubernetes"]
    }
  }
}
```

The server will automatically connect to your current kubectl context. Make sure you have:

1. kubectl installed and in your PATH
2. A valid kubeconfig file with contexts configured
3. Access to a Kubernetes cluster configured for kubectl (e.g. minikube, Rancher Desktop, GKE, etc.)

You can verify your connection by asking Claude to list your pods or create a test deployment.

If you have errors, open up a standard terminal and run `kubectl get pods` to see if you can connect to your cluster without credentials issues.

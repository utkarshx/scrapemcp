# MCPE Server Proxy
This helps with joining MCPI-Revival servers on MCPE (0.6.1), MCPI, or old versions of MCPI-Revival.

The scipt will work without a preset but please use one, you can have one for each server if you want

To set a preset just replace the "example.tk" in [line 7](https://github.com/Red-exe-Engineer/MCPE-Server-Proxy/blob/main/main.py#L7) of main.py to have the server address. (For example: "pbptanarchy.tk")

You may need [QPython](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.qpython.qpy3) or [Pydroid3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3).

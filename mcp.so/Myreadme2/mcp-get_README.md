# mcp-get

A command-line tool for installing and managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## About Model Context Protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

## Adding Your Own MCP Server to the Registry

There are two ways to add your MCP server to the registry:

### Option 1: Manual Package List Addition

If you want to maintain your own package:

1. **Create Your MCP Server**: 
   - Develop your MCP server according to the [MCP protocol specifications](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
   - Publish it as either an NPM package (installable via npm) or a Python package (installable via uvx)

2. **Add to Package List**: Add your server to `packages/package-list.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "your-package-name",
      "description": "A brief description of your MCP server",
      "vendor": "Your Name or Organization",
      "sourceUrl": "URL to the source code repository",
      "homepage": "URL to the homepage or documentation",
      "license": "License type (e.g., MIT)",
      "runtime": "node | python"
    }
    ```

    The `runtime` field specifies how your package should be installed:
    - Use `"runtime": "node"` for packages that should be installed via npm
    - Use `"runtime": "python"` for packages that should be installed via uvx

3. **Add to Helpers**: If your server requires specific environment variables or configurations, add them to `src/helpers/index.ts`.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Fork this repository, add your package details, and submit a PR.

### Option 2: Community Servers Repository

If you don't want to manage package deployment and distribution:

1. **Fork Community Repository**: 
   - Fork [mcp-get/community-servers](https://github.com/mcp-get/community-servers)
   - This repository follows the same structure as the official MCP servers

2. **Add Your Server**:
   - Add your implementation to the `src` directory
   - Follow the existing patterns and structure
   - Include necessary documentation and tests

3. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   - Submit your PR to the community servers repository
   - Once merged, your server will be automatically added to the registry

Both options require following the [MCP protocol specifications](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Choose the option that best fits your needs:
- Option 1 if you want full control over your package distribution
- Option 2 if you want to avoid managing package deployment and distribution

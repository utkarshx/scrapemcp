# Meta MCP Server

"Meta" because it's an MCP Server that Creates MCP Servers. And also because "suck it, Zuck, I got it first" (seriously though I made that connection after the fact).

## Features 

AI (poorly) Created Content:

- **Dynamic Server Generation**: Allows for the creation of customized MCP servers by specifying directories and files to be created.
- **Automated File Management**: Handles the creation of necessary directories and files for new servers automatically.
- **MCP Tool Integration**: Utilizes the Model Context Protocol SDK to manage tools and resources efficiently.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management to ensure stability even when facing invalid inputs or system errors.
- **Debugging Support**: Detailed logging and system prompts to aid in debugging and operational transparency.

2. "Based on what I've told you about this bug already, make a bug report for the authentication system" → use `create_issue` to create a new high-priority issue with appropriate details and status tracking

3. "Find all in progress frontend tasks" → use `search_issues` to locate frontend-related issues with in progress task

4. "Give me a summary of recent updates on the issues for mobile app development" → use `search_issues` to identify the relevant issue(s), then `linear-issue:///{issueId}` fetch the issue details and show recent activity and comments

5. "What's the current workload for the mobile team?" → combine `linear-team:///{teamId}/issues` and `search_issues` to analyze issue distribution and priorities across the mobile team

# MCP Get Community Servers

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/mcp-server-rememberizer)](https://smithery.ai/server/mcp-server-rememberizer)

A [Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) server for interacting with Rememberizer's document and knowledge management API. This server enables Large Language Models to search, retrieve, and manage documents and integrations through Rememberizer.

Please note that `mcp-server-rememberizer` is currently in development and the functionality may be subject to change.

## Components

### Resources

The server provides access to two types of resources: Documents or Slack discussions

### Tools

1. `rememberizer_search`

   - Search for documents by semantic similarity
   - Input:
     - `q` (string): Up to a 400-word sentence to find semantically similar chunks of knowledge
     - `n` (integer, optional): Number of similar documents to return (default: 5)
     - `from` (string, optional): Start date in ISO 8601 format with timezone (e.g., 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z). Use this to filter results from a specific date (default: None)
     - `to` (string, optional): End date in ISO 8601 format with timezone (e.g., 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z). Use this to filter results until a specific date (default: None)
   - Returns: Search results as text output

2. `rememberizer_agentic_search`

   - Search for documents by semantic similarity with LLM Agents augmentation
   - Input:
     - `query` (string): Up to a 400-word sentence to find semantically similar chunks of knowledge. This query can be augmented by our LLM Agents for better results.
     - `n_chunks` (integer, optional): Number of similar documents to return (default: 5)
     - `user_context` (string, optional): The additional context for the query. You might need to summarize the conversation up to this point for better context-awared results (default: None)
     - `from` (string, optional): Start date in ISO 8601 format with timezone (e.g., 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z). Use this to filter results from a specific date (default: None)
     - `to` (string, optional): End date in ISO 8601 format with timezone (e.g., 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z). Use this to filter results until a specific date (default: None)
   - Returns: Search results as text output

3. `rememberizer_list_integrations`

   - List available data source integrations
   - Input: None required
   - Returns: List of available integrations

4. `rememberizer_account_information`

   - Get account information
   - Input: None required
   - Returns: Account information details

5. `rememberizer_list_documents`

   - Retrieves a paginated list of all documents
   - Input:
     - `page` (integer, optional): Page number for pagination, starts at 1 (default: 1)
     - `page_size` (integer, optional): Number of documents per page, range 1-1000 (default: 100)
   - Returns: List of documents

## Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install Rememberizer Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/mcp-server-rememberizer):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install mcp-server-rememberizer --client claude
```

### Using uv (recommended)

When using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), no specific installation is needed. Use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to directly run _mcp-server-rememberizer_.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

- `REMEMBERIZER_API_TOKEN`: Your Rememberizer API token

You can register an API key by create your own [Common Knowledge in Rememberizer](https://docs.rememberizer.ai/developer/registering-and-using-api-keys).

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "rememberizer": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-rememberizer"],
      "env": {
        "REMEMBERIZER_API_TOKEN": "your_rememberizer_api_token"
      }
    },
}
```

## Debugging

Since MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging
experience, we strongly recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).

You can launch the MCP Inspector via [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /path/to/directory/mcp-servers-rememberizer/src/mcp_server_rememberizer run mcp-server-rememberizer
```

Upon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.

# Neo4j MCP Clients & Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a [standardized protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for managing context between large language models (LLMs) and external systems. 

This lets you use Claude Desktop, or any MCP Client, to use natural language to accomplish things with Neo4j and your Aura account, e.g.:

* `What is in this graph?`

## Servers

### `mcp-neo4j-cypher` - natural language to Cypher queries

### `mcp-neo4j-memory` - knowledge graph memory stored in Neo4j

### `mcp-json-memory` - knowledge graph memory stored in a file

A reference server for modeling memory as a knowledge graph.

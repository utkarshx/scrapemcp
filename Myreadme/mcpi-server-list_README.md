# Setup

go to `/client/index.html` and change `https://checker.mcpi.host` to your server adress, and if you want your own server list, change `https://pythonscratcher.pics/p/raw/60zeimoq39`.
## What is cors.rare1k.workers.dev?
becuase of moderm browsers having too many security measures, this bypasses CORS, because i was too lazy to implement it.  
if the link doesnt work try:
- `https://cors.rare1k.dev/`
- `https://cors-anywhere-web.up.railway.app/`
- `https://cors-anywhere-oragne.vercel.app/api/cors?url=`
( i am not responsible for theese btw)

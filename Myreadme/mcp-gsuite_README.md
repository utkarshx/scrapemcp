## Quickstart

### Install

### Installing via Smithery

To install mcp-gsuite for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/mcp-gsuite):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install mcp-gsuite --client claude
```

#### Oauth 2

Google Workspace (G Suite) APIs require OAuth2 authorization. Follow these steps to set up authentication:

1. Create OAuth2 Credentials:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Gmail API and Google Calendar API for your project
   - Go to "Credentials" → "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID"
   - Select "Desktop app" or "Web application" as the application type
   - Configure the OAuth consent screen with required information
   - Add authorized redirect URIs (include `http://localhost:4100/code` for local development)

2. Required OAuth2 Scopes:
   

```json
   [
     "openid",
     "https://mail.google.com/",
     "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar",
     "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"
   ]
```

3. Then create a `.gauth.json` in your working directory with client

```json
{
    "web": {
        "client_id": "$your_client_id",
        "client_secret": "$your_client_secret",
        "redirect_uris": ["http://localhost:4100/code"],
        "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
        "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
    }
}
```

4. Create a `.accounts.json` file with account information

```json
{
    "accounts": [
        {
            "email": "alice@bob.com",
            "account_type": "personal",
            "extra_info": "Additional info that you want to tell Claude: E.g. 'Contains Family Calendar'"
        }
    ]
}
```

You can specifiy multiple accounts. Make sure they have access in your Google Auth app. The `extra_info` field is especially interesting as you can add info here that you want to tell the AI about the account (e.g. whether it has a specific agenda)

Note: When you first execute one of the tools for a specific account, a browser will open, redirect you to Google and ask for your credentials, scope, etc. After a successful login, it stores the credentials in a local file called `.oauth.{email}.json` . Once you are authorized, the refresh token will be used.

### Configuration Options

The MCP server can be configured with several command-line options to specify custom paths for authentication and account information:

* `--gauth-file`: Specifies the path to the `.gauth.json` file containing OAuth2 client configuration. Default is `./.gauth.json`.
* `--accounts-file`: Specifies the path to the `.accounts.json` file containing information about the Google accounts. Default is `./.accounts.json`.
* `--credentials-dir`: Specifies the directory where OAuth credentials are stored after successful authentication. Default is the current working directory with a subdirectory for each account as `.oauth.{email}.json`.

These options allow for flexibility in managing different environments or multiple sets of credentials and accounts, especially useful in development and testing scenarios.

Example usage:

```bash
uv run mcp-gsuite --gauth-file /path/to/custom/.gauth.json --accounts-file /path/to/custom/.accounts.json --credentials-dir /path/to/custom/credentials
```

This configuration is particularly useful when you have multiple instances of the server running with different configurations or when deploying to environments where the default paths are not suitable.

## Development

### Building and Publishing

To prepare the package for distribution:

1. Sync dependencies and update lockfile:

```bash
uv sync
```

2. Build package distributions:

```bash
uv build
```

This will create source and wheel distributions in the `dist/` directory.

3. Publish to PyPI:

```bash
uv publish
```

Note: You'll need to set PyPI credentials via environment variables or command flags:
* Token: `--token` or `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN`
* Or username/password: `--username`/`UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME` and `--password`/`UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD`

### Debugging

Since MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging
experience, we strongly recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).

You can launch the MCP Inspector via [ `npm` ](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /path/to/mcp-gsuite run mcp-gsuite
```

Upon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.

You can also watch the server logs with this command:

```bash
tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-mcp-gsuite.log
```

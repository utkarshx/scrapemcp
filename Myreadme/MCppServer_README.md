## 🌍 Use Pre-Generated World
Just put the world folder of your Vanilla Minecraft world in the Directory where the server executable is and it will be loaded when the server starts.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Linux Compatibility:** The Linux version has not been thoroughly tested. You may encounter issues when running MCpp Server on Linux systems. To still be able to join the server, you should turn off online mode in the config.json file.
- **Ongoing Development:** MCpp Server is actively being developed. Contributions and feedback are welcome to help improve the server.
